2. Clothing item upload/URL import
3. Basic outfit generation using Gemini API
4. Occasion-based outfit suggestions (minimum 3 occasions)
5. Interactive outfit preview
6. Working deployment accessible to judges

### Nice-to-Have Features

5. Mobile app optimization

## Code Architecture Guidelines

### File Structure
```
/src
  /components
    /forms
      - UserPhotoUpload.tsx
      - ClothingItemForm.tsx
      - OccasionSelector.tsx
    /ui
      - Button.tsx
      - Modal.tsx
      - LoadingSpinner.tsx
    /outfit
      - OutfitGenerator.tsx
      - OutfitPreview.tsx
      - ItemSwapper.tsx
  /lib
    - gemini-client.ts
    - image-utils.ts
    - outfit-engine.ts
  /pages
    /api
      - generate-outfit.ts
      - upload-image.ts
    - index.tsx
    - profile-setup.tsx
    - wardrobe.tsx
```

### Key Components to Build

#### 1. GeminiService (`/lib/gemini-client.ts`)
```typescript
class GeminiService {
  generateOutfit(userPhoto: string, clothingItems: ClothingItem[], occasion: string): Promise<GeneratedImage>
  validateImage(imageData: string): boolean
  handleRateLimit(): void
}
```

#### 2. OutfitGenerator (`/components/outfit/OutfitGenerator.tsx`)
```typescript
interface OutfitGeneratorProps {
  userPhoto: UserPhoto
  availableClothing: ClothingItem[]
  selectedOccasion: Occasion
  onOutfitGenerated: (outfit: GeneratedOutfit) => void
}
```

#### 3. ClothingCatalog (`/components/wardrobe/ClothingCatalog.tsx`)
```typescript
interface ClothingCatalogProps {
  items: ClothingItem[]
  onItemSelect: (item: ClothingItem) => void
  onItemAdd: () => void
  categories: ClothingCategory[]
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Hour 20: Core Functionality Testing
- [ ] Test image upload with various formats and sizes
- [ ] Verify Gemini API integration with real clothing items
- [ ] Test outfit generation for all occasion types
- [ ] Validate mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Check error handling for API limits

### Hour 22: User Experience Testing
- [ ] Complete user journey from setup to outfit generation
- [ ] Test with different user photo qualities
- [ ] Verify clothing URL import functionality
- [ ] Check performance with multiple clothing items
- [ ] Test sharing and export features

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] API keys secured and tested
- [ ] Database connections established
- [ ] Static assets optimized
- [ ] Error logging implemented

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] SSL certificate active
- [ ] Custom domain configured (optional)
- [ ] Performance monitoring active
- [ ] Demo data populated
- [ ] Public access verified

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **API Rate Limits**: Implement caching and request queuing
2. **Image Quality**: Add preprocessing and validation
3. **Performance**: Optimize image sizes and API calls
4. **User Experience**: Focus on core flow first

### Fallback Plans
1. If Gemini API fails: Static demo with pre-generated images
2. If deployment issues: Use local demo with screen recording
3. If complex features fail: Focus on basic outfit generation
4. If time runs short: Prioritize video demo over additional features

## Success Metrics
- User can complete full styling journey in under 2 minutes
- Outfit generation completes in under 15 seconds
- App works seamlessly on mobile and desktop
- Demo video showcases clear value proposition
- All submission requirements met with quality execution
