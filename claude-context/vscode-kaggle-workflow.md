## Local Development Workflow

### 1. Daily Development Process
```bash
# Morning setup
git pull origin development
npm install                    # Install any new dependencies
npm run dev                   # Start development server

# Development cycle
# 1. Code new feature
# 2. Add documentation (component .md files)
# 3. Test functionality
# 4. Commit with descriptive message

# Evening wrap-up
npm run build                 # Test production build
git add .
git commit -m "feat: [description of work done]"
git push origin development
```

### 2. Testing Strategy
```bash
# Component testing as you build
npm run test                  # Unit tests
npm run test:integration      # Integration tests
npm run test:e2e             # End-to-end tests (if implemented)

# Manual testing checklist
# - Upload different image formats and sizes
# - Test with various clothing combinations
# - Verify mobile responsiveness
# - Check error handling
# - Test API rate limiting behavior
```

### 3. Documentation As You Code
```typescript
// Before writing any component, create its documentation file
// Example: Before coding OutfitGenerator.tsx

// 1. Create OutfitGenerator.md with:
//    - Component purpose and features
//    - Props interface and examples  
//    - Usage patterns and customization
//    - Integration points with Gemini API

// 2. Then implement OutfitGenerator.tsx with:
//    - JSDoc comments for all functions
//    - Inline comments for complex logic
//    - Performance considerations noted
//    - Error handling documented
```

## Collaboration with Neha (Creative/Marketing)

### 1. Shared Documentation
```markdown
# For Neha's reference, maintain these files:
- /docs/component-guide.md      # What each component does
- /docs/demo-scenarios.md       # Different user flows for video
- /docs/visual-examples.md      # Screenshots and visual references
- /public/demo-images/          # Sample images for testing/demo
```

### 2. Asset Integration Workflow
```bash
# When Neha provides assets:
1. Add to /public/demo-images/ folder
2. Update demo data in code
3. Document asset usage in component .md files
4. Test with new assets and document results
```

### 3. Demo Video Coordination
```markdown
# Maintain shared checklist for demo video:
- [ ] App deployed and stable
- [ ] Demo data populated with good examples
- [ ] All major features working smoothly
- [ ] Mobile version tested and responsive
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully
- [ ] Screenshots and recordings captured
```

## Final Submission Process

### 1. Code Freeze and Review
```bash
# 2 hours before deadline
git checkout main
git merge development          # Final merge
npm run build                 # Final build test
npm run test                  # Final test run

# Deploy to production
# Test deployed version thoroughly
# Update all documentation with final URLs
```

### 2. Kaggle Submission Checklist
```markdown
## Final Submission Items
- [ ] Kaggle writeup submitted (200 words exactly)
- [ ] Demo video uploaded and link verified
- [ ] Public GitHub repository link working
- [ ] Live demo application accessible
- [ ] All documentation complete and current
